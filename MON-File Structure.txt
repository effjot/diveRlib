Questions and Investigations

What is Instrument number?


Import into Diver Office, logger not yet present in database
=> [Logger settings] section:
      ignored: Serial number, Location

   [Series settings] section:
      Serial number, Location taken from here


Import into Diver Office with logger/location already in database, new Serial number in both sections
=> new dataset with new Serial number from [Series settings], old dataset keeps Serial number

   Diver Properties in Diver Office shows new Serial number (from [Series settings])


Import into Diver Office with logger/location already in database, new Location only in [Series settings]
=> Diver Office creates new location


Import into Diver Office with logger/location already in database, new Location only in [Logger settings]
