Questions and Investigations
============================

Exported MON files
------------------

What is Instrument number?


Import into Diver Office, logger not yet present in database
=> [Logger settings] section:
      ignored: Serial number, Location

   [Series settings] section:
      Serial number, Location taken from here

   Location always lower case, even with upper case in both Logger settings and Series settings.


Import into Diver Office with logger/location already in database, new Serial number in both sections
=> new dataset with new Serial number from [Series settings], old dataset keeps Serial number

   Diver Properties in Diver Office shows new Serial number (from [Series settings])


Import into Diver Office with logger/location already in database, new Location only in [Series settings]
=> Diver Office creates new location


Import into Diver Office with logger/location already in database, new Location only in [Logger settings]
=> Import into existing location as new dataset


"Identification" of channels: in my files I found (find . -type f -exec fgrep Identifi {} \; | cut -d = -f 2 | sort | uniq) the following terms for the water level channel:

 * Baropegel
 * LEVEL
 * Pegel
 * PRESSURE
 * Wasserstand



Backup files
------------

only old LDM program, in C:\Programme\LDM\EXE\BackupsOfReadings\

are also MON files

Decimal separator is COMMA! (At least on my German Windows XP.)
